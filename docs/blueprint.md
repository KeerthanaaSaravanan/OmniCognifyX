# **App Name**: OmniMind Orchestrator

## Core Features:

- Simulated Workflow Creation: Allow users to design and define automated workflows using a drag-and-drop interface, simulating the watsonx Orchestrate environment.
- AI Task Simulation: Enable simulation of AI-driven tasks, like data analysis, sentiment analysis, and content generation, within the workflows.
- Data Input Simulation: Provide tools to simulate data ingestion from various sources (e.g., CSV files, simulated APIs) as input for the workflows.
- Visual Workflow Monitoring: Offer a dashboard to visualize the status and progress of running workflows with simulated real-time updates and metrics.
- AI-Powered Parameter Recommendations: Suggest optimal configurations and parameters for the AI tasks within the workflows, using a generative AI tool that considers performance and cost-efficiency factors.
- Access Control Simulation: Simulate role-based access controls for managing permissions and access to workflows and data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft blue (#64B5F6), evoking IBM's brand while providing a calm, modern feel.
- Background color: Very light blue (#F0F8FF), providing a clean and unobtrusive backdrop for content.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), used sparingly to highlight key actions and elements without overpowering the overall design.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font that offers a modern and neutral look, ideal for both headlines and body text.
- Use flat, minimalist icons in shades of blue to represent different tasks and data types.
- Emphasize a clear, modular layout with consistent spacing and alignment to ensure readability and ease of use.
- Subtle animations, like progress bars and transitions, to provide visual feedback on workflow execution.
